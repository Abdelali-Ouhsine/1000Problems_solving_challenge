# 🚀 1000 Problems Challenge — Problem Solving & Data Structures

Welcome to my personal coding journey!
This repository is dedicated to solving **1000 problems** to sharpen my skills in **problem solving, algorithms, and data structures**.
Each problem I solve helps me become a better thinker, programmer, and software engineer.

---

## 🎯 Goal

The main goal of this project is **to improve my logical thinking and problem-solving skills** through consistent practice.
By the end of this challenge, I aim to:

* Solve 1000 coding problems from various platforms (HackerRank, LeetCode, Codeforces, etc.)
* Strengthen my understanding of **data structures** and **algorithms**
* Learn to write **clean, efficient, and optimized code**
* Document my progress and solutions in a clear, reusable format
* (printf is forbiden in functions)
---

## 🧩 Topics Covered

Throughout this journey, I’ll explore and practice problems related to:

* Arrays and Strings
* Linked Lists
* Stacks and Queues
* Trees and Graphs
* Sorting and Searching
* Recursion and Backtracking
* Dynamic Programming
* Bit Manipulation
* Greedy Algorithms
* Mathematical and Logical Puzzles
